## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.JS installed to run this project. If you don't already have
it installed, you can can download the installer
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You can alternatively install Node.JS
using a version manager like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Setup

#### Installing dependencies

From the root of this project, run `npm install` to install dependencies. If you
have `yarn` installed, you can install dependencies by running `yarn`.

#### Loading credentials

Create a `.env` file at the root of this project and add environment variables
to match what is in `src/instanceConfigFields.json`. The `.env` file is ignored
by git, so you won't have to worry about accidentally pushing credentials.

Given this example configuration:

```json
{
  "clientId": {
    "type": "string"
  },
  "clientSecret": {
    "type": "string",
    "mask": true
  },
  "tenant": {
    "type": "string",
    "mask": true
  }
}
```

You would provide a `.env` file like this:

```bash
CLIENT_ID="client-id"
CLIENT_SECRET="supersecret"
TENANT="tenant-directory-id"
```

The snake cased environment variables will automatically be converted and
applied to the camel cased configuration field. So for example, `CLIENT_ID` will
apply to the `clientId` config field, `CLIENT_SECRET` will apply to
`clientSecret`, and `MY_SUPER_SECRET_CONFIGURATION_VALUE` will apply to a
`mySuperSecretConfigurationValue` configuration field.

## Running the integration

To start collecting data, run `yarn start` from the root of the project. This
will load your configuration and execute the steps defined by the
`IntegrationInvocationConfig`.

## Project structure

The only requirement of an integration is to provide a `src/index.(ts|js)` which
exports a `invocationConfig: IntegrationInvocationConfig` property.

This project is an instance of the
[integration template project](https://github.com/JupiterOne/sdk/tree/master/template),
which provides a bit more structure.
